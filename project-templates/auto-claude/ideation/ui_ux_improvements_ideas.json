      "description": "Implement real-time search results preview as users type in the search modal, displaying product suggestions before form submission.",
      "rationale": "Currently the search modal only shows 'Press Enter to see all results' hint after typing. Live search results significantly improve UX by reducing friction, helping users find products faster, and enabling discovery of related items they might not have searched for directly.",

      "current_state": "The search modal has an input field with popular search suggestions. When users type more than 2 characters, they see a hint to press Enter. No live results are shown during typing.",
      "proposed_change": "Add an Alpine.js-powered live search that: 1) Debounces input (300ms) after 3+ characters, 2) Fetches results from /api/front/products with title search, 3) Displays up to 5 product matches with images, titles, and prices, 4) Shows a 'See all X results' link to the full search page. Include skeleton loading state during fetch.",
      "user_benefit": "Users can immediately see matching products without leaving the modal, reducing time-to-product by 50%+ and enabling quick navigation directly to desired items.",

      "rationale": "The current 404 page is minimal - just a large '404', brief text, and a home link. Users who land on broken links are high-intent visitors who deserve a better recovery path. An enhanced 404 can recover these potential customers.",

      "proposed_change": "Redesign 404 page to include: 1) Friendly illustration or icon instead of stark '404', 2) Inline search bar allowing users to search from the error page, 3) Grid of 4 featured/promo products below search, 4) Links to main category pages, 5) Contact support link.

      "proposed_change": "1) Add :focus-visible selector to show wishlist button when focused via keyboard (.product-card:focus-within .product-card-wishlistBtn should also trigger visibility), 2) Add visible focus ring with outline or box-shadow matching the design system, 3) Add aria-label to the button describing its toggle state ('Add to wishlist' / 'Remove from wishlist'), 4) Ensure tabindex='0' is present.
